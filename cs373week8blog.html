<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>March 13, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was recovering from sleep deprivation and catching up before spring break. Also planning out for this project and others. It was also full of anticipation on how I did on my test, and I can say I am satisfied with my grade, just wish I had started to study a few more days in advance.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way this week, is doing a little school work despite being on spring break. Procrastinating would not go well in the long run, so I will do my best to avoid it. However, I think this break should also be a good thing since it will give me some time for personal hobbies to give my mind a break.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>As you obviously know this week is spring break, so it will be spend mostly on personal projects (I am a huge gear head and have some work to do on my project car). However, this week will be ensuring that I do not procrastinate as previously stated. I have to get started on my 3 CS projects, and I need to make a good amount of progress on each of them this week. I also have some more prep work to do with moving up to Seattle.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>So class was the usual experience. The guest lecturer however, put in a bit of a twist since I have not done too much database work, so there was some to learn there. The tools he presented seemed that they would be very useful for this project, and should make things much easier (at least from the limited knowledge I currently have). However, for Friday we got a little gift of no class, which was very nice and Downing gave the advice to use the time to ensure that we were prepared for next week.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW goes along with my last TOTW. Believe in yourself and your abilities, be confident. When interviewing I tried to go in with the most confidence not just in my CS related abilities, but in myself as a person. This actually got my best internship offer, because the interviewer was most impressed with my enthusiasm and un-nervousness.</p>
