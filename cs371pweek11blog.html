<h1>CS371p Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>April 10, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was working on the Darwin project. It was very challenging but interesting. I feel as if we have been programmed to use getters and setters and this is the first time I have heard of them being "bad" to use. The big issue I had was defining what was and wasn't a getter or setter, since the line can be very tough to see at times. On top of this project I had 2 other projects and a paper so I had little if any free time each day.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way is finishing up the semester strong. I do not have anything due this week besides a few small assignments, but I should get a start on whatever is due next week, as well as starting to ensure that I am organized for my last/final exams. I also have some personal projects that may get in the way, so I will have to try and put them on hold.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This week will be getting a head start on my projects and recovering from the last two weeks which were full of work for every course I am currently in. I will also start the home search in Seattle this week so that I do not have to stress about it last minute before moving up there.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class this week was very interesting. I had confronted the issue of the default constructors and copy assignment operator in Darwin since I was using swap in order to swap the species of two objects when hopping into an empty space. Fortunately I did not have to write either of these since the underlying datastructure I was using was a vector and ints. I was called on for a question in class and was able to answer it correctly.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW this week is to talk to people in the atrium that visit from various FOCS and other companies. This is a great way to get over the nerve of talking to recruiters and interviewers with really no negative side effect (unless it is a company that you actually plan on applying to). It is also a great way to actually get an interview, since your personality plays a big part in how hirable you are, not just your technical skills.</p>
