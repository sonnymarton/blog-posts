<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>March 6, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was preparing for 2 tests, one for this class and also for another one of Downing's classes. This took quite a bit of time, which unfortunately meant I got behind on some tasks for other classes. The tests themselves had a lot of material on each, and I was unsure of what to expect since the content of the test was not made super clear, however what was on the test was not hit to left field.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>Since I had the two exams last week, I am now a bit behind in my other classes on reading assignments, so I envision this week will entail a late night or two. I also have to start preparing for my big move to Seattle, including finding a place to live.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>I will be using this week to catch up on my other classes as well as getting an early start on the programming projects to come, in both of Downingâ€™s classes as well as Mobile Computing. I am also getting started on my music ethnography which will need to have some time spent in the library.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class last week was putting together the concepts we learned in class in order to successfully create an iterator. I do not recall being called on, however I know that the questions being asked took some intuition of the topics we were going over, since at this point we were putting all we learned together.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is interview as much as you reasonably can, regardless if you are looking for an internship or job yet. Multiple interviews gets you in the swing of things, and ultimately removes a lot of nerves in interviews to come. There still may/will be nerves, however they will be much better handled. Personally I had always been nervous when going into interviews, however after getting a few under my belt, I found that confidence was key. Once I was able to have confidence in my interviews, I was getting great responses and feedback from the interviewers, as well as a few internship/job offers.</p>
