<h1>CS371p Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>February 14, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was another very eventful week, which is a pain since I originally believed this semester, my final semester, would be somewhat easy. However that is not the case. I found a partner for the Voting project, and got started on it. The partner and I got acquainted and we talked out a solution to the problem and how to approach it, especially the aspects of the "test first" since it is relatively new to both of us. Once we got familiar with the project we made a plan of attack and went at it, with great success.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way for this week is getting both of my project finish, but luckily today is almost over, it has been filled with working on various other homework so that I ensure that I have time this week. Not much else seems to be in my way as I am now in the groove of school and getting used to my schedule and time commitment.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>Next week will be taking a day off for my birthday, then getting back into the school routine. Finding partners for the new project will likely be a priority so that I can again get an early start to the projects. After the week has started I will have to start studying for upcoming tests.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>This week in class was learning some of the ins and outs and dos and don'ts of C++. It is very interesting to see the similarities and differences when compared to other OOP languages. I did not get called out this week on any questions, though I do believe I am coming up on the list of what is coming up people to be called on. We also had a guest lecturer come and give professional advice and knowledge on agile programming in an actual company, specifically Main Street Gub.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW from me this week, find a personal project you like and have at it. A personal project always has a little heart behind it and is a great way to learn. Work with a language and/or tools that you have not worked with before. Work in an area you have not worked in before, etc. This learning experience on personal projects has been great to me and has been a valuable tool in the past</p>
