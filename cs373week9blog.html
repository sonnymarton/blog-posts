<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>March 27, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was getting my two projects finished and starting a new one. However, before that came recuperating from spring break and get myself into the swing of things once more. I had to particularly focus on my schedule since I had to meet with a few different groups. Overall it was a very productive week.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way for this coming week is a lot. I have 3 CS projects and a rough draft of a music ethnography that I have due soon. This along with my regular assignments and readings will be a task in itself. I also have some more future planning to do for my big move after college.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This week I will ensure that I am on task so that I am able to get everything done. I will have to limit my free time and hobbies, but may reward myself a little if I am on task.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class this week was very typical. We learned some more ins and outs of C++, especially about const and what it means in the various scenarios in which it can be used. It was familiar to me in most cases, but there were a few where it really opened up my eyes to what is actually going on. Ultimately giving me a better understanding.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is to do something out of your comfort zone on projects if you get a chance. On projects, doing something I previously had no experience with has really opened up my eyes. I have found a lot of areas that I like in computer science by doing this. If you have always done front end, do some back end and vis versa.</p>
