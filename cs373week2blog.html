<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>January 31, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was getting into the groove of things. Setting up the environment on my Windows 10 machine and getting everything integrated.  With this class using Python I first setup my environment, but then changed my mind and decided to swap over and use Cygwin instead, which took a bit of learning in itself.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>Python is a language that I have only come across once or twice in the past, I learned on Java, so hopefully parallels can be made. Syntax is a bit weird from what I am used too, but it seems to make sense, if it didnâ€™t then no one would use it. I actually look forward to it, since what I do know about Python is that it is very useful and knowing a lot of languages can never hurt.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>Next week will be prepping for the next project and preparing for other exams in other classes, so I will need to ensure that I have good time management.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class was again a good experience. I believe the professor wants us to full engage in class so that we can recall the things that we have learned. The forced interaction of answering questions is very engaging and ensures that I am on my toes and paying a lot of attention to what is being said so that I am ready to answer, or at least try and answer, and question that is asked.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>A tip from this week would be to continue to read up on things that are changing in the tech world around you. In an interview my interviewer had asked me about a very niche subject that I had only come across from a random article I had come across on Facebook, needless to say it led to a follow-up interview and my internship</p>
