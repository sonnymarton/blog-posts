<h1>CS371p Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>May 1, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was thinking I had time to relax, but quickly realizing I couldn't. I had a paper to finish and a few small assignments that I wanted out of the way so that I would not have to deal with them this last upcoming week of school. I also had a weekend full of a wedding and other family events so I knew I would have little time to do the homework I wanted.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way is 3 tests, an Android project, 2 presentations and a music event. Needless to say it will be a very hectic week. Lots of material was covered and lots of things I still need to ensure I have thorough knowledge of for the exams. I will go out with a bang though and push through.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>As stated above I have what may be the most hectic week of my college career. I will be ensuring that I waste no time. In order to do this I will be sure to block ALL social media and car related websites (I am a gear head) from my computer and phone so that I do not waste any time.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class this week was the typical experience. We jumped more into different handles and how they are implemented. However one big difference was that we did not have quizzes on Wednesday or Friday, which was nice, but at the same time I like to be challenged against the concepts that we have learned so that I have forced myself to deeply think about the topics we have covered. So in this case, which I know sounds terrible, I would have liked to have quizzes.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is to find a study pattern that works for you. There are several recommended ways to study and plenty can be found with a quick google search. I myself am very good at cramming for whatever reason but I still find that it does not work as well for me if I have started to study in advance.</p>
