<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>April 10, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was working on various projects and hw assignments. The IDB2 project proved to be a task and unfortunately we were not able to get Docker working correctly after it had a crash a few hours before the original deadline. We worked at it the next day but still had no luck, and even worked on it again on Saturday but still nothing. The biggest issue was that all was working fine and then just stopped and we received various errors that we were not able to work around.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way is finishing up the semester strong. I do not have anything due this week besides a few small assignments, but I should get a start on whatever is due next week, as well as starting to ensure that I am organized for my last/final exams. I also have some personal projects that may get in the way, so I will have to try and put them on hold.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This week will be getting a head start on my projects and recovering from the last two weeks which were full of work for every course I am currently in. I will also start the home search in Seattle this week so that I do not have to stress about it last minute before moving up there.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class has been eye opening this past week since I have a very shallow background in database related topics. However, the class lectures along with working with building the api was a great learning experience. The quizzes were challenging this week and very thought provoking, and have given me a large hint on what I will need to focus on for the final exam.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW this week is to talk to people in the atrium that visit from various FOCS and other companies. This is a great way to get over the nerve of talking to recruiters and interviewers with really no negative side effect (unless it is a company that you actually plan on applying to). It is also a great way to actually get an interview, since your personality plays a big part in how hirable you are, not just your technical skills.</p>
