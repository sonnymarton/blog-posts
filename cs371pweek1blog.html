<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>January 24, 2016</p>

<p>First and foremost it should become obvious that this post is almost the same as my CS 373 post for week 1, the material taught in both in the first week were very much the same, if not identical. As the weeks go by I am sure that this will no longer be the case since the information taught will diverge from one another.</p>

<p>This past week was a game of getting up on my feet and running for my last semester, theoretically speaking. This may end up being the most challenging semester I have had here at the University of Texas so it is a mental game which I have been preparing for. Besides the normal stuff of ordering books and trying to work out my school schedule I have particularly tried to prepare myself for this class by clearly understanding the outlines and the commitments that I must make in order to do well.</p>

<p>Being a senior in my last semester as well as already having a job lined up may be the biggest obstacle in my way if laziness sets in. However I do not believe it will be much of an issue since I look forward to the information that will be presented and taught in this course, things which will help me at my new job.</p>

<p>This upcoming week will be full of figuring out my schedule to a greater degree so that I do not waste time. I am still trying to get into the schedule of school after a long and much needed break. This week will also present the class projects which I look forward to working on.</p>

<p>The format of the class is somewhat typical of a CS class, the professor comes in with new information while presenting code that he has written over the projector, however a forced response from students is what is somewhat new. It is very interesting to me since I am typically used to responding to more questions and in this case I must hold back, an issue I think needs to be overcome. The style of the professor however is one that engages the student, whether they like it or not and I look forward to the life lessons of a software developer/engineer that I will learn. The professor seems to teach not only on what he has learned academically but also professionally from being in the field. </p>

<p>Relevant to this exact post and something I am sure I will use in the future is Jekyll, and its use on my Windows machine. I have strayed far from web dev for the most part and it was something new to me. A great write up I found to get me started was here.</p>

<p>The biggest thing I will take out of this blog, at least I hope, is a better way to express technical and computer related topics in ways that interests others in computer science.</p>
