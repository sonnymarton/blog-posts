<h1>CS371p Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>April 3, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was preparing for what will be the worst week of this semester and trying to stay on task as much as possible. I had an exam in a non-CS class so there was a day spent on that, which took away a day of CS work (which is what I tend to focus on).</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way is 3 CS projects, a music paper outline and a statistics exam. Needless to say I will have plenty to do, all of these things along with normal class work/readings. The largest issue with this is that when I am overloaded with work I tend to waste time until the last second in which I am actually forced to get the work done.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This next week will be ensuring that I am on task. I have said this many times in my blog posts, but this week will require the most concentration yet. I will be staying up late nights for sure, along with meeting with 2 groups for my projects (I have chosen to work on one of them alone so that I do not have to worry about scheduling conflicts).</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>This week included a typical class experience, however the guest speakers were the most interesting to me as of yet. Steve and Mark from Atlassian stepped us through the process of Scrum (an agile development methodology) and the tools that they use to aid in this process. It was interesting seeing the contrast from the tools I have used at Microsoft during my internship.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is to find a mentor while in college, preferably one that is a professional in the CS field. This can give you a resource that is invaluable for advice and information on how things actually happen, remember school doesn't teach you everything. When getting to my internship I quickly realized that school projects are nothing like the work that you will do in the real world, and the things you need to know are quite different (note that both of Downing's classes have been very valuable and the most real-world-like when compared to other CS classes).</p>
