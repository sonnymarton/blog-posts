<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>February 28, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was mostly a break from school before ramping up for the next wave of exams. My birthday was this past week and some time off was definitely nice and got my mind cleared and ready to review. Got my new 3D printer setup and did some test prints.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In the future I foresee studying for this test as well as another test for Downing. We have covered a lot of information since school has started and it is a lot to review, so I will have to ensure that I am on task with reviewing and studying for the test. Also there are one or two readings which I did not do so there is a little catching up to do.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This week is full study for exams mode. Included in this is not only reading over what we have done in class but also working out similar problems and hopefully putting together a study group for each of my classes. I always find group studying to be beneficial.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>There was a guest lecturer who was very informative on the ins and outs of open source software/tools and what we can do to play our part in it. I have used some open source software but have yet to contribute, so maybe that should be a change I could work on. The other days of class was coming to the realization that we have an exam coming up. The quizzes proved to be a bit more challenging and very Python specific, I overlooked the fact of set notation in Python.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is on 3D Printing. After doing some initial research it seemed that there were a few well reviewed 3D printers, however it seemed to show a front running in the self-assembled, open source and budget category, a Prusa I3. Prusa I3 is just a design and there are multiple companies/people building their specific model and some can be found for a great price on eBay or Amazon. All the software included is open source and free as well.</p>
