<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>May 8, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was finishing the last week of my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of Austin. Even though it was the last week it was possibly the worst week of my college career as well. There were 3 exams, a project and 2 presentations which were no easy task. However I wanted to go out with a bang so I made sure to push through.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way is one final, and I will be on my way to the next chapter of my life. I will also be completing all paper work so that I am on my way to being a graduate of the university.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This next week will be getting over the excitement of almost being finished. The one final I have I am not overly concerned about as it should be fairly easy.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class this week was more presentations of other teams presenting their final IDB project, which include my team. It was a bit nerve wracking as this would ultimately compare us to other teams on our project, however I personally believe that we did a decent job. There was also no class on Friday as there was a test on Thursday night.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is to push through. College has been one of the greatest and worst experiences of my life. The indescribable fun and great things I have done in the past 4 years can never be replaced. However, it has not been all fun and games and I have had to push myself at times since the end goal is going to be very rewarding.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>This is to wrap up my thoughts on Downing's Software Engineering course. Note that this response is VERY similar to that of my final thoughts for OOP since they were taught very similarly. This has been a very difficult course, however I can now consider myself much more capable software engineer. This class will be one of the most beneficial college courses I have ever taken. It has been one of the most real world experiences I have had in any course in not only the concepts but also the tools we are forced to be used. If you are reading this and considering taking this course, DO IT (however I do not recommend you take it at the same time as Downing's OOP)! One thing it has definitely taught me is team collaboration, as I have never had to work with a team on a project of this scope, where everyone is specialized in what they do.</p>
