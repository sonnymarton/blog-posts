<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>April 24, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was working on the DB project, however for my assigned tasks it was a lot less technical than the last projects. I got a start on testing the other team's API and then went through the website and updated a few small things here and there for better format and appearance. Aside from this I put some time into working on the Life project for Downing's OOP which took a little time earlier in the week.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>All CS projects for the semester are finished aside from the Android App I have to write for Mobile Computing, which is a relief. However I have 2 presentations, a few exams and a paper to get a head start on this week. So as always, I will have to ensure that I am on task and do not waste time doing other things.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This upcoming week I will be sure to get a head start on the cheat sheet and reviewing for the class. There was a lot of material covered since the last exam and along with this is the biggest issue of still being uncomfortable with SQL calls (since we seemed to focus on it for a while, so I am sure it will be on the exam). I will be sure to focus more on other assignments I have so that I can be sure and focus on the exams next week without having to worry about the assignments.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>This week we dove into refactoring a bit more heavily. I am much more familiar with this material than what we came across previously which is a delight since I should not have to focus on it as much when studying. I was also called on and I was able to answer the question at hand.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is to take classes in different areas of CS. I know it can be difficult to take the classes that you want if you are anyone but a senior, however if you have the opportunity take a class outside your comfort zone, do it. I have taken a few out of the norm classes from what I like and they ended up being very useful. You can never know too much in CS, and being well rounded is ALWAYS a good thing in a future employerâ€™s eyes.</p>
