<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>February 14, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was another very eventful week, which is a pain since I originally believed this semester, my final semester, would be somewhat easy. However that is not the case. I found a partner for the Voting project, and got started on it. I found a partner in class by asking a random fellow I had seen around a few times, and he accepted my offer of being project partners. We met the next class day and talked about the problem for Netflix and got to talking about a solution. We started with going over the requirements and went from there and started to get stuff knocked out. This all went smoothly and luckily he is easy to work with and takes and gives constructive input.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way for this week is getting both of my project finish, but luckily today is almost over, it has been filled with working on various other homework so that I ensure that I have time this week. Not much else seems to be in my way as I am now in the groove of school and getting used to my schedule and time commitment.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>Next week will be taking a day off for my birthday, then getting back into the school routine. Finding partners for the new project will likely be a priority so that I can again get an early start to the projects. After the week has started I will have to start studying for upcoming tests.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>This week was learning more of Python (specifically Python 3) and its characteristics. Some of these unknown to me and very interesting. When coming across the zip() function I was excited since I had already learned to use it when writing the solution for the Netflix project. We also had a guest lecturer come and give professional advice and knowledge on agile programming in an actual company, specifically Main Street Gub.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW from me this week, find a personal project you like and have at it. A personal project always has a little heart behind it and is a great way to learn. Work with a language and/or tools that you have not worked with before. Work in an area you have not worked in before, etc. This learning experience on personal projects has been great to me and has been a valuable tool in the past</p>
