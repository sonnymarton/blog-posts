<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>April 17, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was a recovery from the last round of project and catching up on some of my reading and homework. It also included getting started on the projects that are due this upcoming week, so that I can make it easier on myself and my team. I also had to put some time in and focus on my other classes (non-CS) which I usually push to the backburner.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way is the IDB project. This week for myself, is less technical aspects of the project, and more on the presentation and critique side. This will still prove to be a task since I will have to make sure that I work in conjunction with my other teammates throughout the process.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This next week will be first focusing on the other project I have for SWE, and hopefully be able to finish it early, so I can put complete focus on the IDB project after. It is likely that I will have to switch back and forth with them however.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class this past week was finishing up SQL and starting refactorings. I have dealt with refactorings before in Software Development so the idea is present and the refactorings that we covered were also fairly straight forward, unlike some in the later readings. One of the quizzes also required the reading to be done, so I was able to answer the questions.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is the make a schedule or to do list at the beginning of each week. I know this seems pointless to some people since they never follow a schedule, much like myself. However, the biggest benefit I find from this is that fact that I have thought out my week and even if I do not reference the to do list I subconsciously know what I need to do for the week without giving it too much thought.</p>
