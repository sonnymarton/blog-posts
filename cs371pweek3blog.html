<h1>CS371p Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>February 7, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was one full of things to do. Between 3 projects and some writing to do I was short on time. I had started the project for this class a bit early. I have not used C++ in a semester or two, I have most recently used Java and C#, so picking back up on C++ was a chore I had to take care of. Luckily, my other class, also had a similar project and I was able to use my short Python program to produce acceptance tests so that I did not have to rewrite the test script. Getting the code itself written was not the difficult part, the difficult part was learning to use all the tools and to remember what little Github I knew. The major issue I had was with google test, which I could not get integrated and working with Cygwin on my Windows 10 machine, despite the documents saying that it should work. However, once I got rolling all went well.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way for this week is the projects to come and ensuring that I not only get an early start but that I keep that early start going. This semester, despite being my last, may be the most hectic and hopefully worthwhile ones. Besides CS classes I have a music class and a statistics class and I am trying to follow the readings from class and ensure that I am engaged in these classes and not just wing them so that I can graduate, money is being spent so I should make the most of it</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This upcoming week will be full of school work and catching up from the weekend I had off (wedding and family stuff). I will also have to find a partner for both of my upcoming projects, which should be a good way to connect with some more CS students, something I do not do as much as I should.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class got a bit more intense and in depth this past week which helped get me back into the details of C++, which I needed. The quizzes however were a bit more challenging than the previous week, and these I did not do as hot as I would have liked to, but hopefully I can carry what I learned into the tests to come.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>A TOTW for this week is going to be to get breakfast every day. There are plenty of articles online about the benefits in health but also cognitive ability throughout the day. The following article is short and sweet but there are plenty more on the web.</p>
