<h1>CS371p Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>April 17, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was a recovery from the last round of project and catching up on some of my reading and homework. It also included getting started on the projects that are due this upcoming week, so that I can make it easier on myself and my team. I also had to put some time in and focus on my other classes (non-CS) which I usually push to the backburner.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way is the Life project for this class. I have decided to attack it alone, since I already have to meet with two other groups for other projects. I have gotten a decent start at it so I hope that I am able to get it done a few days early so I can focus on my SWE project, catsgalore.me.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This next week will be focusing on the Life project for this class as well as the database/website for Downing's other class, SWE. The life project seems to be a bit more involved than the previous projects, and the twist that he has added to the project (having T as Cell, not just Conway or Fredkin cell) has added a bit of complexity to the design of the program.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class this past week was over inheritance and its ins and outs in C++. It has some quirks that make it special from other languages, but as a whole it seems to make sense. We also covered friends, and what friendship means in C++. The highlight of the d*mn class was "Why are friends bad in C++? They can access your private parts!"</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is the make a schedule or to do list at the beginning of each week. I know this seems pointless to some people since they never follow a schedule, much like myself. However, the biggest benefit I find from this is that fact that I have thought out my week and even if I do not reference the to do list I subconsciously know what I need to do for the week without giving it too much thought.</p>
