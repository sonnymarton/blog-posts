<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>February 21, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This last week was working on the Voting project and getting closer with the tools that we were to use on the project. The problem was straight forward and it came to be that our initial solution already had a few small optimizations in it without actually considering them as optimizations. The project overall went well and we were able to get it accepted on UVa. I had spent lots of time this week in the GDC lab or atrium working on this project or the Netflix project for Downing's Software Engineering class.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way for the week is ensuring that I start to prepare for the tests coming up and the projects as well. I have a little more free time this week, but I need to ensure that I spend it wisely and do not fiddle around. I also have my non-cs classes starting to ramp up, so preparing for those has also come to the front of my To Do list.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This upcoming week will consist of ensuring that I am caught up with all work and readings for all of my classes. My birthday is also this week so I will be laid back on that day, likely taking the day off before I start up on the next projects. Once I get back in the swing of things I will be likely pulling some late nights just to make sure I am caught up on all that I need to do, mainly my non-cs classes.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class was learning more about Python and its iterators, generators, lists, yielding and more. I got called on this week, and the pressure of the spot light hit me, despite knowing the solution I was slow to answer and couldn't get it out. Working on being in the spotlight is something I will for sure thing about more.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is to get out of your comfort zone, and beyond it. I have found that hobbies unrelated to tech/computer science are a good way to get my mind off of school. I am a huge gear head and am spending lots of time on the weekends researching the next best part for my car and installing them. Fine tuning my car for road racing. Cars are my way of freeing my mind and giving it a break from CS.</p>
