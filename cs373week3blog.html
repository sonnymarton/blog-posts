<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>February 7, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was one full of things to do. Between 3 projects and some writing to do I was short on time. I had started the project for this class a bit early, however I had to take some time out to learn Python and the differences it had from what I was used to. Once I got a decent idea I went with it and worked on the project and wrote a script to produce the acceptance tests for the project. Getting the code itself written was not the difficult part, the difficult part was learning to use all the tools and to remember what little Github I knew. However, once I got rolling all went well.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way for this week is the projects to come and ensuring that I not only get an early start but that I keep that early start going. This semester, despite being my last, may be the most hectic and hopefully worthwhile ones. Besides CS classes I have a music class and a statistics class and I am trying to follow the readings from class and ensure that I am engaged in these classes and not just wing them so that I can graduate, money is being spent so I should make the most of it</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This upcoming week will be full of school work and catching up from the weekend I had off (wedding and family stuff). I will also have to find a partner for both of my upcoming projects, which should be a good way to connect with some more CS students, something I do not do as much as I should.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class this past week was much like the previous classes, however since we got deeper into the class material I had a bit more trouble on the quizzes. I am unsure of Python and some of its difference from other languages I am familiar with. I did get called on and I was luckily engaged so that I was able to answer the question asked</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>A TOTW for this week is going to be to get breakfast every day. There are plenty of articles online about the benefits in health but also cognitive ability throughout the day. The following article is short and sweet but there are plenty more on the web.</p>
