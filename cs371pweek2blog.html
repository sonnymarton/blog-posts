<h1>CS371p Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>January 31, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was getting into the groove of things. Setting up the environment on my Windows 10 machine and getting everything integrated. The C++ environment took a little while to setup because I decided to use Cygwin for a Linux like environment</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>I am a bit rusty on C++ and it has been a few semesters since I have used it. I will need to pick things back up but I do not think it will be an issue as long as I dedicate time to it. It came naturally in the past and I hope it is like riding a bike again.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>Next week will be prepping for the next project and preparing for other exams in other classes, so I will need to ensure that I have good time management.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class was again a good experience. I believe the professor wants us to full engage in class so that we can recall the things that we have learned. The forced interaction of answering questions is very engaging and ensures that I am on my toes and paying a lot of attention to what is being said so that I am ready to answer, or at least try and answer, and question that is asked.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>A tip from this week would be to continue to read up on things that are changing in the tech world around you. In an interview my interviewer had asked me about a very niche subject that I had only come across from a random article I had come across on Facebook, needless to say it led to a follow-up interview and my internship</p>
