<h1>CS371p Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>February 21, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This passed week was full of attacking the Netlfix project. The problem itself is fairly straightforward, but the method of actually solving the problem became a bit more of a concern. The data provided was enough to get the rmse below 1, but it took small tweaks to get it even further below an rmse of 1. I had spent lots of time this week in the GDC lab or atrium working on this project or the Voting project for Downing's Object Oriented Programming.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way for the week is ensuring that I start to prepare for the tests coming up and the projects as well. I have a little more free time this week, but I need to ensure that I spend it wisely and do not fiddle around. I also have my non-cs classes starting to ramp up, so preparing for those has also come to the front of my To Do list.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This upcoming week will consist of ensuring that I am caught up with all work and readings for all of my classes. My birthday is also this week so I will be laid back on that day, likely taking the day off before I start up on the next projects. Once I get back in the swing of things I will be likely pulling some late nights just to make sure I am caught up on all that I need to do, mainly my non-cs classes.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class was learning more ins and outs of C++, mainly iterators and their multiple types and what they demand. This week Downing ensured that we got our minds working so that we can start looking to the test that is in a little less than two weeks. I was not called on this week which was strange, and I am fairly certain that some of those around me have been called on multiple times since the last time I have been called on. I am sure there is some method to this madness.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is to get out of your comfort zone, and beyond it. I have found that hobbies unrelated to tech/computer science are a good way to get my mind off of school. I am a huge gear head and am spending lots of time on the weekends researching the next best part for my car and installing them. Fine tuning my car for road racing. Cars are my way of freeing my mind and giving it a break from CS.</p>
