<h1>CS371p Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>April 24, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was full of working on the Life project for the class. It was one of the more challenging projects, conceptually, but I was able to figure out the handler class after a little thought. I also spent a bit of time working on the website/db project for Downing's other class, SWE, which took a bit of time since I met with my other group members in this time.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>All CS projects for the semester are finished aside from the Android App I have to write for Mobile Computing, which is a relief. However I have 2 presentations, a few exams and a paper to get a head start on this week. So as always, I will have to ensure that I am on task and do not waste time doing other things.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>This upcoming week I will be sure to get a head start on the cheat sheet and reviewing for the class. There was a lot of material covered since the last exam, however I believe I have a pretty good grasp on everything. I will be sure to focus more on other assignments I have so that I can be sure and focus on the exams next week without having to worry about the assignments.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class this week was very interesting and pertained to the project, however it seemed to come a little late for me since I got a very early start on the project and finished it a little early. It was reassuring to see that I was able to come up with the same solutions as we did in class for the project. I was also called on and I was able to answer the question correctly.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is to take classes in different areas of CS. I know it can be difficult to take the classes that you want if you are anyone but a senior, however if you have the opportunity take a class outside your comfort zone, do it. I have taken a few out of the norm classes from what I like and they ended up being very useful. You can never know too much in CS, and being well rounded is ALWAYS a good thing in a future employerâ€™s eyes.</p>
