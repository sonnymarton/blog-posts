<h1>CS373 Spring 2016: Sonny Marton</h1>

<p>May 1, 2016</p>

<p>What did you do this past week?</p>
<p>This past week was thinking I had time to relax, but quickly realizing I couldn't. I had a paper to finish and a few small assignments that I wanted out of the way so that I would not have to deal with them this last upcoming week of school. I also had a weekend full of a wedding and other family events so I knew I would have little time to do the homework I wanted.</p>

<p>What's in your way?</p>
<p>In my way is 3 tests, an Android project, 2 presentations and a music event. Needless to say it will be a very hectic week. Lots of material was covered and lots of things I still need to ensure I have thorough knowledge of for the exams. I will go out with a bang though and push through.</p>

<p>What will you do next week?</p>
<p>As stated above I have what may be the most hectic week of my college career. I will be ensuring that I waste no time. In order to do this I will be sure to block ALL social media and car related websites (I am a gear head) from my computer and phone so that I do not waste any time.</p>

<p>Class Experience</p>
<p>Class this week was the typical experience for Monday, however Wednesday and Friday were not. Other groups presented their projects which for the first group included a critique of our website which was somewhat interesting to see what we missed since we have a emic point of view. There was also no quiz for these days, which was nice and a change of things.</p>

<p>Tip-Of-The-Week</p>
<p>TOTW is to find a study pattern that works for you. There are several recommended ways to study and plenty can be found with a quick google search. I myself am very good at cramming for whatever reason but I still find that it does not work as well for me if I have started to study in advance.</p>
